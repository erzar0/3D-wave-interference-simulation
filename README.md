### Project made for Computer Graphics class at university. It's purpose is to show interference between two waves. 
Technologies used: 
- SFML for drawing polygons
- ImGui for GUI
- Eigen (with help of OpenMP) for fast vector/matrix operations that enabled us to achieve reasonably fast 3D projections

### Example of compiled program can be seen below:
