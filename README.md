Project made for computer graphics class at university. It's purpose is to show interference of two 3D waves. 
Technologies used: 
- SFML for drawing polygons
- ImGui for gui
- Eigen (with help of OpenMP) for fast vector/matrix operations that enabled us to achieve reasonably fast 3D projections
Example of compiled program can be seen below:
